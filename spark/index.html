                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Let’s talk specs. The Tesla Model S P90D produces 762 horsepower, can travel an EPA estimated 253 miles, and can hit 60mph from a standstill in 2.8 seconds. After those 253 miles are up, all you have to do is plug it into a wall socket for a while, much like a toaster, and you are off. The Model S can be had in many flavors, ranging from around $70,000 to well over $100,000. This is all very impressive, but these numbers have been forced down consumers’ throats for years now and I believe these are not the reasons to buy a Tesla. I believe that the reason to buy a Tesla is not to show off the technological advancements, but rather to save yourself from having to talk about them.</p>
                        <p>In the past, when an electric or hybrid car drove by, it was usually draped in very boxy, sad, but drag­reducing and optimal body and the reason for this is that these cars were engineered, not designed. Imagine the contradistinction between an original Rembrandt painting and a 90’s fax machine. The Rembrandt was created in a state of passion and emotion. The whole purpose is to invoke a feeling in its beholder, a feeling that is very personal and intimate. A fax machine was made so that it doesn’t overheat, so there are systematic holes and vents. It wails when turned on, almost as if even it is aware of its miserable existence and the fact that it looks like a giant hearing­aid. The fax machine is an appliance, where the Rembrandt is a manifestation of humanity without actually serving a well­defined purpose. Early iterations of electric and hybrid cars were much like the fax machine, in that they turned on, served as an appliance, and then turned off. Tesla though, does something special. They put emotion into engineering, and the byproduct was that they created something useful as well as beautiful. They created something between the Rembrandt and the fax machine.</p>
                        <p>I want to believe that instead of thinking only about optimal power delivery and drag reduction, they thought about color and emotion. I want to believe that they thought about
Batman wildly ramping the batmobile over buildings and through walls. I want to believe that they thought about being crammed into the back of a minivan as a child with an overstuffed suitcase under their legs, and stopping for McDonalds at the state border. I want to believe that they remember frantically washing a hand­me­down oldsmobile because prom was in 2 hours because no one was going to see that stiff, old suit behind the wheel of a sparkling car. And as a result, I wanted to believe that there was still a future for the love and the bond between man and machine. I can’t help but be comforted that Tesla incorporates features such as “Ludicrous Mode” where the car changes its personality into a track­tuned hypercar. I can’t help but smile at Tesla’s option of putting rear facing seats in the trunk hatch so kids can stare out the back window just like a command bridge of a ship. I can’t help but scratch my head at the Model X Crossover’s rear doors, since they use gullwing doors that open upwards, hinged at the top instead of conventional doors. The mad scientists at Tesla even incorporate Little “Easter­egg” features that are hidden in the infotainment system of the car so that months after buying the car, you can still be entertained by new and exciting quirks. For example, in one of the menu screens of the infotainment system, an image of the tesla can be changed to the Lotus Esprit that James Bond drove in T he Spy Who Loved Me, s imply because Elon Musk is a huge fan of Bond and he actually owns said Lotus.</p>
                        <p>With a Tesla, you don’t have to excuse your socially responsible car as one had to in past years. No more, “Yes it may share design cues with a cashew, but it gets 70 miles per gallon!”, and gone are the days of “Ah yes, that bulge in the rear quarter panel that vaguely looks like a growth reduces drag by 0.7 percent!”. Only in the past was it mandatory to recite the fact sheet on your eco­car to prove that you had a reason to buy one. Now all you have to do is plant your foot deep into the back of the footwell, and let the car speak for itself.</p>

                        <h3>Hot: Hoverboards - </h3>
                        <p>You’ve seen them by now, people cruising along effortlessly on little “hoverboards” that actually don’t hover.  Surprisingly, the real question isn’t whether they hover or not, but rather are they too dorky to blow hundreds of dollars on a futuristic reiteration of a scooter.  After making appearances on music videos, under celebrities, and around campus, we have decided that hoverboards aren’t just hot in the I-want-to-enjoy-this-in-secret kind of way, but rather more in the let's-show-everyone-my-moves kind of way. There are currently many companies that make these little guys, but some familiar names in the hoverboard market include Razor, Solowheel, and Swagway (yep that’s the name of a real company). </p>
                        <h3>Not: Apple Watch - </h3>
                        <p>Even though its intentions were good, the Apple Watch did not hit as hard as anticipated.  People expected apple to breathe life into watches the same way they did with phones.  Apple essentially redefined the utility of a phone by making the iPhone so much better than anything that had been released before, that people were completely won over by it.  What Apple essentially did with the Apple Watch is extend the the utilities of the iPhone by allowing users to not even have to pull their phone out of their pocket to interact with it. While this isn’t a bad thing, consumers expected Apple to “Pull an Apple” and reinvent the wheel a second time.</p>
                        <h3>Hot: Drones - </h3>
                        <p>Drones have been soaring in popularity as of recent. They have grown from something used primarily by the armed forces to clever devices used by scientists to monitor endangered animals, farmers to monitor their crops, scientists to track hurricanes and predict weather patterns, and even by the average human as a hobby. Some companies, including Amazon, have already begun to use drones for delivery purposes, with many more companies expected to follow in the near future. Due to their wide range in cost, drones have become affordable regardless of what their uses are, with some drones costing less than $20 to some costing well over $1000.</p>
                        <h3>Not: Google Glass - </h3>
                        <p>It’s been nearly two years since the media began heavily publicizing Google Glass, however, Google hasn’t made much progress in bringing their much awaited product out of beta. Google has announced numerous changes to their product within the last year and has even hired the former head of the Google Nest division to lead the team. Though Google is still working on their product, the progress has been too slow for eager customers and the company has also stopped selling the Glass after ending their beta program earlier this year, casting more doubt in consumers. </p>
                        <h3>Not?: Wii U - </h3>
                        <p>Nintendo's Wii U is not living up to the reputation of its predecessor. The Wii was incredibly successful because it catered to a wider demographic and had the games to back it up, despite the fact that it lacked the support of third-party developers (i.e. studios that don't make games for a single console). The Wii U launched with better third-party games, including several big AAA releases, such as Assassin's Creed III and Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but many third-party developers are still leaving the Wii U as an afterthought, and are sometimes forced to neuter their games due to its weaker hardware. Some critics also considered the Wii U too expensive at launch ($250), but after a $50 price drop in mid 2013 and the release of several games from popular Nintendo franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD, the console is now much more affordable and has more great games than it did at launch.
	To be fair, the Wii U does a lot right. Its controller has garnered praise for its unique screen that unlocks new ways to interact with the game, and Nintendo's smash hits like Super Smash Bros. 4 and Mario Kart 8 are as fun as ever. However, the Wii U needs better third-party support to be considered a good alternative to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for the more hardcore gamers out there.</p>

                        <h2 class="post-title">Mobile Money</h2>
                    </header>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Mobile payments are the future. Due to their convenience and security, mobile payments are becoming a more promising option to many consumers and as a result the global market for mobile payments is expected to soar from about $400 billion to over $720 billion by the year 2017 and an astonishing $2.8 trillion by the year 2020. The market for mobile payments is expected to be one of the largest areas of growth for the next several years, due largely to the number of people who will have access to smartphones. Currently only about 2.5 billion of the worlds 7 billion people are smartphone users, however by 2020 that number is expected to soar to 6.1 billion smartphone users, with the growth largely fueled by developing markets. This huge growth in smartphone users will lead to the revolution in mobile payments. </p>
                        <p>Mobile payment is to a very broad term, which can refer to any of the numerous different categories of mobile payments. One of these categories is In-app mobile payments, which involves a third party application that sells its unique product to a user and allows the user to make a payment right within the app to avoid making a payment in person. Starbucks and Dominos are two corporations that use in-app mobile payments. Another category is contactless mobile payments, which uses near field communication (NFC) to complete transactions. Contactless mobile payments can be completed by simply waving a mobile device, credit/debit card, or fob across the terminal. Examples of such payments include Android Pay, Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and Samsung Pay. Peer to Peer Payments (P2P) is another popular form of mobile payment, which involves the transfer of money between individuals with a text message, email, or a third party application. Examples of P2P payments include Venmo, Google Wallet, and Square Cash. The last form of mobile payment is MPOS (mobile point of sales), which uses a smartphone/tablet to accept credit/debit card payments from customers. This type of payment often involves the use of a plug-in card reader along with a mobile application, which has an interface that is similar to a traditional register. Examples of MPOS are VeriFone and Square.  </p>
                        <p>The most promising aspects of Mobile payments are their reliability and convenience. Mobile payments are also attractive to many users because of their security. In general these new payment methods are significantly more secure than the traditional forms of payments. For example Google Wallet and Android Pay both have 24/7 Fraud monitoring and the user receives an instant notification immediately after a transactions. Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay also have tamper resistant security chips, which protect the secret codes used to make payments and these tamper resistant chip guards against physical attacks and malware on your smartphone, making it a safer option than a traditional credit card. Select smartphone users also have the privilege to use biometric authentication to protect their information on their smartphones. </p>
                        <p>Venmo is a popular P2P mobile payment method that has been soaring in popularity. P2P mobile payments have risen in popularity due mainly to their convenience. P2P payments have made sending and receiving money from family and friends easier than ever. According to company data, Venmo has handled over $2 billion dollars in transactions last quarter, up about half a billion dollars from the previous quarter. Venmo’s simplicity and sturdy security system, which uses data encryption to store customers financial information on their servers, makes it a popular app for customers. Venmo is also working with merchants to develop a platform where customers can make payments using Venmo which would make it a strong competition to the larger tech giants and their own mobile payment platforms: Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay. </p>
                        <p>Many businesses, both small and large, have begun to shift away from the traditional way of payment and adopt these new technologies. Many companies have integrated these new technologies into their businesses. One of these companies is Starbucks, where mobile payments account for over 20% of their business. Mobile payments, however, are having a much more significant impact on small businesses rather than large corporations. Small to medium sized businesses are finding it more convenient and cost effective to switch to payment methods such as Square and VeriFone. Square for example charges small businesses a flat 2.75 percent fee per swipe, which is significantly lower than the combined fees that many small and medium sized businesses receive from credit card companies.</p>
                        <p>A handful of banks have also begun to embrace mobile technology in order to run their businesses. Earlier this year Citibank and BMO Harris Bank began testing new card-less ATMS, which are capable of making transactions using just a mobile phone. The ATM allows users to use Near Field Communication (NFC) or a QR code to authenticate themselves and complete any transaction for which they previously needed a card for before. </p>
                        <p>Given the significant advances in mobile payments and banking, people are quickly switching from these traditional forms of payments and starting to embrace these new methods, indicating that it won’t be too long before society completely decides to ditch plastic and paper for a completely electronic method. </p>

                        <h3>Rosetta</h3>
                        <p>The Rosetta probe and its lander Philae, launched by the European Space Agency in March 2004, reached their destination in August of last year: the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. This marks the first ever extended examination of a comet.</p>
                        <p>67P/C-G is a comet from the Kupier belt, a part of the solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune and home to many small bodies formed along with the Sun and the planets. This region of space is home to several dwarf planets, including Pluto, and is thought to be where some of the Solar System's moons originated, such as Neptune's Triton. Many objects in the Kupier belt consist largely of frozen water, methane, or ammonia, examples of volatiles that are found in large quantities in the crusts and atmospheres of planets and moons. Volatiles are characterized by low boiling points (less that 100 K, or about -173°C) and can be found in gaseous and solid form.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the Rosetta mission is to develop our understanding of the formation of our solar system 4.6 billion years ago, when the Sun, planets, and other objects formed from the gravitational collapse of a giant cloud of gas called a molecular cloud. The composition of this cloud is reflected in the composition of comets such as 67P.</p>
                        <p>Both spacecraft have been hard at work. Philae has detected 16 organic molecules in the thin atmosphere around Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, four of which have never been detected in comets before (methyl isocyanate, acetone, propionaldehyde and acetamide). This means that comets crashing into Earth billions of years ago could have contributed to the conditions that later would allow life to develop on our planet by depositing large amounts of water, carbon, and hydrogen.</p>
                        <p>In October 2015, Rosetta uncovered another surprise in the comet's wispy atmosphere: molecular oxygen (O2). Oxygen is highly reactive, so finding some that has not yet combined with other molecules over billions of years is very unusual. Furthermore, data from Rosetta shows that the oxygen levels around 67P have been stable from September 2014 to March 2015, suggesting that oxygen is found throughout the comet's body. One hypothesis is that high energy particles in the molecular cloud could have hit ice grains and broken bonds in water molecules, trapping oxygen in the ice. These ice grains would later come together to form comets like 67P.</p>
                        <p>Rosetta is currently in orbit around the comet and has been collecting data continuously for more than a year. Philae is still on the comet's surface, in the shadow of an upraised slope and hundreds of meters from the intended landing site due to equipment failure during landing. Unfortunately, its solar panels could not sustain operation due to low levels of sunlight, and Philae was forced to shut down all instruments on November 15th, 2014. Due to better lighting conditions on the comet's surface, Philae awakened on June 13, 2015 and operated intermittently until July 9 when the ESA could not achieve consistent contact and send the lander new instructions.</h3>
                        <h3>New Horizons</h3>
                        <p>NASA's New Horizons, launched in January 2006, took nine years to reach its primary target: Pluto, a dwarf planet located in the Kupier belt. The piano-sized spacecraft conducted a six month long observation of Pluto this year, concluding with its closest approach on July 14th, and is now speeding even farther away from the Sun. The spacecraft is loaded with seven instruments for thermal and composition maps, analysis of Kupier belt objects' atmospheres, and a high-resolution telescopic camera for geologic data. New Horizons also has a device created by students at the University of Colorado Boulder to measure the space dust that hits the spacecraft.</p>
                        <p>New Horizons began observing Jupiter and four of its moons in January 2007 while using the gas giant for a gravity-assisted speed boost. It took detailed black-and-white photos of Jupiter, and scanned its atmosphere, magnetic field, and rings. It also measured the composition and topography of Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, as well as detailed images of the icy surface of Callisto and Io's volcanic activity. Lastly, New Horizons flew through the long “tail” of Jupiter's magnetic field, which extends many miles beyond the planet.</p>
                        <p>Long distance observations of the Pluto system began in January 2015, and the flyby occurred on July 14th, with New Horizons only 12,500 km (7,800 mi) away at the closest point. Some of the data has been received, including amazing pictures of Pluto and Charon, but the full set of has not yet arrived. We now know that Pluto has a thin nitrogen atmosphere and that its surface ice, composed mostly of varying concentrations of nitrogen and methane, probably sublimates and becomes part of the atmosphere when Pluto is closer to the Sun, and freezes to become snow as the dwarf planet leaves the Sun's warmth. Analysis of large craters in Pluto's icy plains suggests that its crust has distinct layers, and as on Earth, the deeper the layer, the further back in time we can see.</p>
                        <p>The spacecraft's transmissions include closeups of Pluto's four small moons: Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. While the Hubble Space Telescope discovered Nix and Hydra in 2005, Kerberos in 2011, and Styx in 2012, close-up images were not possible until now. Charon, the largest of Pluto's moons, is enormous, with one eighth Pluto's mass and half its diameter. This causes the center of mass of the Pluto-Charon system to lie outside Pluto, reminiscent of binary star systems in which both objects seem to orbit each other, rather than the more familiar depiction of a small moon orbiting a nearly stationary planet. Gravitational forces in Charon force it to be spherical due to its mass, but the four small moons of Pluto are too small for this to happen, so they all appear irregularly shaped. Nix, the largest of the four, is about 54 km × 41 km × 36 km, while Styx, the smallest, is only 5 km × 2.6 km (in 2D area; the last dimension is unknown).</p>
                        <p>All bodies in the Pluto system are largely composed of ices (solid water, ammonia, and other volatiles) and rock, which is consistent with the composition of Kupier belt objects in general. Pluto is classified as a dwarf planet – an object in orbit around the Sun that has enough mass for its own self-gravity to pull it into a spherical shape. However, the current definition of planet also requires a distinct orbit that does not cross another planet's orbit, and Pluto crosses through Neptune's orbit. Charon also fits the definition of a dwarf planet, but it is currently classified as a satellite of Pluto.</p>
                        <p>New Horizons is currently heading deeper into the Kupier belt with a new mission: a flyby of a Kupier belt object (KBO) called 2014 MU69. The mission goals include mapping the surface geology and surface temperature of the KBO, determining its surface composition to compare it with other KBOs such as dwarf planets and comets, and estimating or measuring its mass. However, funding needs to be secured for this extended mission, with the verdict to be announced in August or September 2016. New Horizons will begin observing the KBO in October 2018 and begin its closest encounter on January 1, 2019. If this mission is approved, 2014 MU69 will be the farthest object ever explored.</p>
                        <p>In 2038, New Horizons will be 100 AU away from Earth, a distance defined as a hundred times the distance from Earth to the sun. This distance is approximately where the heliosphere ends, the region of space dominated by the sun, and where interstellar space begins. NASA's Voyager 1, launched in 1977, was the first human-made object to reach interstellar space in August 2012. If New Horizons survives, it can observe this region of space we know little about.</p>

                        <h3>Why Did Mars's Atmosphere Disappear?</h3>
                        <p>In November of this year, NASA revealed that MAVEN, a spacecraft orbiting above Mars, has found evidence that the red planet could have had an atmosphere thick enough to support liquid water on its surface.</p>
                        <p>Where did that atmosphere go? It's been lost to solar wind – plumes of ions from the upper atmosphere of the sun – 4.2 to 3.7 billion years ago, according to MAVEN principle investigator Bruce Jakosky. MAVEN has observed, under normal solar conditions, a loss of about 100 grams of atmosphere per second due to solar wind, but in March 2015, MAVEN reported 10 to 20 times that rate due to type of solar storm called a coronal mass ejection (CME). Furthermore, we know that the Sun was more active four billion years ago, and would have produced more CMEs, stripping away the Martian atmosphere even faster.</p>
                        <p>Four billion years ago might not seem like a particularly interesting time. However, it has significance here on Earth; early life, in the form of tiny microbes, formed about four billion years ago. The same could have happened on Mars before it lost its atmosphere and most of its liquid water.</p>
                        <h4>About MAVEN</h4>
                        <p>MAVEN stands for Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission. As its name suggests, its purpose is to investigate how the atmosphere of the red planet has changed over time and the effects of that evolution on the planet's surface. The probe was launched in November of 2013 and arrived at Mars in September 2014.</p>
                        <h4>Liquid Water on Mars</h4>
                        <p>Mars is a very cold planet, with temperatures reaching down to -110°C, but that doesn't stop liquid water from flowing on its surface.</p>
                        <p>Researchers using an imaging spectrometer on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have found traces of hydrated salts in dark streaks on slopes and hillsides. These streaks seem to flow downwards during warm seasons and recede during colder ones. This phenomenon, known as recurring slope lineae (RSL), occurs because the salts lower the freezing point of the brine, allowing the water to keep its liquid form. Researchers suspect that the water is mostly found under the surface, with only a fraction reaching the surface and causing the dark discoloration. RSL has been found in several locations on Mars, including the walls of several large craters.</p>
                        <p>Further research is needed to explain the source of the water and the inner workings of RSL.</p>
                        <h4>About MRO</h4>
                        <p>Launched in 2005, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter began observing Mars from orbit in late 2006. It can take images of the Martian surface using several high-resolution cameras in the visual spectrum and/or ultraviolet, as well as two optical spectrometers (devices that display light intensity as a function of frequency or wavelength) operating in the infrared and visual ranges. These images are used to study the history of water on Mars and assist researchers in their missions on the surface.</p>
