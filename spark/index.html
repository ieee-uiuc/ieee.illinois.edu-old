                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Let’s talk specs. The Tesla Model S P90D produces 762 horsepower, can travel an EPA estimated 253 miles, and can hit 60mph from a standstill in 2.8 seconds. After those 253 miles are up, all you have to do is plug it into a wall socket for a while, much like a toaster, and you are off. The Model S can be had in many flavors, ranging from around $70,000 to well over $100,000. This is all very impressive, but these numbers have been forced down consumers’ throats for years now and I believe these are not the reasons to buy a Tesla. I believe that the reason to buy a Tesla is not to show off the technological advancements, but rather to save yourself from having to talk about them.</p>
                        <p>In the past, when an electric or hybrid car drove by, it was usually draped in very boxy, sad, but drag­reducing and optimal body and the reason for this is that these cars were engineered, not designed. Imagine the contradistinction between an original Rembrandt painting and a 90’s fax machine. The Rembrandt was created in a state of passion and emotion. The whole purpose is to invoke a feeling in its beholder, a feeling that is very personal and intimate. A fax machine was made so that it doesn’t overheat, so there are systematic holes and vents. It wails when turned on, almost as if even it is aware of its miserable existence and the fact that it looks like a giant hearing­aid. The fax machine is an appliance, where the Rembrandt is a manifestation of humanity without actually serving a well­defined purpose. Early iterations of electric and hybrid cars were much like the fax machine, in that they turned on, served as an appliance, and then turned off. Tesla though, does something special. They put emotion into engineering, and the byproduct was that they created something useful as well as beautiful. They created something between the Rembrandt and the fax machine.</p>
                        <p>I want to believe that instead of thinking only about optimal power delivery and drag reduction, they thought about color and emotion. I want to believe that they thought about
Batman wildly ramping the batmobile over buildings and through walls. I want to believe that they thought about being crammed into the back of a minivan as a child with an overstuffed suitcase under their legs, and stopping for McDonalds at the state border. I want to believe that they remember frantically washing a hand­me­down oldsmobile because prom was in 2 hours because no one was going to see that stiff, old suit behind the wheel of a sparkling car. And as a result, I wanted to believe that there was still a future for the love and the bond between man and machine. I can’t help but be comforted that Tesla incorporates features such as “Ludicrous Mode” where the car changes its personality into a track­tuned hypercar. I can’t help but smile at Tesla’s option of putting rear facing seats in the trunk hatch so kids can stare out the back window just like a command bridge of a ship. I can’t help but scratch my head at the Model X Crossover’s rear doors, since they use gullwing doors that open upwards, hinged at the top instead of conventional doors. The mad scientists at Tesla even incorporate Little “Easter­egg” features that are hidden in the infotainment system of the car so that months after buying the car, you can still be entertained by new and exciting quirks. For example, in one of the menu screens of the infotainment system, an image of the tesla can be changed to the Lotus Esprit that James Bond drove in T he Spy Who Loved Me, s imply because Elon Musk is a huge fan of Bond and he actually owns said Lotus.</p>
                        <p>With a Tesla, you don’t have to excuse your socially responsible car as one had to in past years. No more, “Yes it may share design cues with a cashew, but it gets 70 miles per gallon!”, and gone are the days of “Ah yes, that bulge in the rear quarter panel that vaguely looks like a growth reduces drag by 0.7 percent!”. Only in the past was it mandatory to recite the fact sheet on your eco­car to prove that you had a reason to buy one. Now all you have to do is plant your foot deep into the back of the footwell, and let the car speak for itself.</p>

                        <h3>Hot: Hoverboards - </h3>
                        <p>You’ve seen them by now, people cruising along effortlessly on little “hoverboards” that actually don’t hover.  Surprisingly, the real question isn’t whether they hover or not, but rather are they too dorky to blow hundreds of dollars on a futuristic reiteration of a scooter.  After making appearances on music videos, under celebrities, and around campus, we have decided that hoverboards aren’t just hot in the I-want-to-enjoy-this-in-secret kind of way, but rather more in the let's-show-everyone-my-moves kind of way. There are currently many companies that make these little guys, but some familiar names in the hoverboard market include Razor, Solowheel, and Swagway (yep that’s the name of a real company). </p>
                        <h3>Not: Apple Watch - </h3>
                        <p>Even though its intentions were good, the Apple Watch did not hit as hard as anticipated.  People expected apple to breathe life into watches the same way they did with phones.  Apple essentially redefined the utility of a phone by making the iPhone so much better than anything that had been released before, that people were completely won over by it.  What Apple essentially did with the Apple Watch is extend the the utilities of the iPhone by allowing users to not even have to pull their phone out of their pocket to interact with it. While this isn’t a bad thing, consumers expected Apple to “Pull an Apple” and reinvent the wheel a second time.</p>
                        <h3>Hot: Drones - </h3>
                        <p>Drones have been soaring in popularity as of recent. They have grown from something used primarily by the armed forces to clever devices used by scientists to monitor endangered animals, farmers to monitor their crops, scientists to track hurricanes and predict weather patterns, and even by the average human as a hobby. Some companies, including Amazon, have already begun to use drones for delivery purposes, with many more companies expected to follow in the near future. Due to their wide range in cost, drones have become affordable regardless of what their uses are, with some drones costing less than $20 to some costing well over $1000.</p>
                        <h3>Not: Google Glass - </h3>
                        <p>It’s been nearly two years since the media began heavily publicizing Google Glass, however, Google hasn’t made much progress in bringing their much awaited product out of beta. Google has announced numerous changes to their product within the last year and has even hired the former head of the Google Nest division to lead the team. Though Google is still working on their product, the progress has been too slow for eager customers and the company has also stopped selling the Glass after ending their beta program earlier this year, casting more doubt in consumers. </p>
                        <h3>Not?: Wii U - </h3>
                        <p>Nintendo's Wii U is not living up to the reputation of its predecessor. The Wii was incredibly successful because it catered to a wider demographic and had the games to back it up, despite the fact that it lacked the support of third-party developers (i.e. studios that don't make games for a single console). The Wii U launched with better third-party games, including several big AAA releases, such as Assassin's Creed III and Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but many third-party developers are still leaving the Wii U as an afterthought, and are sometimes forced to neuter their games due to its weaker hardware. Some critics also considered the Wii U too expensive at launch ($250), but after a $50 price drop in mid 2013 and the release of several games from popular Nintendo franchises, such as The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD, the console is now much more affordable and has more great games than it did at launch.
	To be fair, the Wii U does a lot right. Its controller has garnered praise for its unique screen that unlocks new ways to interact with the game, and Nintendo's smash hits like Super Smash Bros. 4 and Mario Kart 8 are as fun as ever. However, the Wii U needs better third-party support to be considered a good alternative to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for the more hardcore gamers out there.</p>

                        <h2 class="post-title">Mobile Money</h2>
                    </header>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Mobile payments are the future. Due to their convenience and security, mobile payments are becoming a more promising option to many consumers and as a result the global market for mobile payments is expected to soar from about $400 billion to over $720 billion by the year 2017 and an astonishing $2.8 trillion by the year 2020. The market for mobile payments is expected to be one of the largest areas of growth for the next several years, due largely to the number of people who will have access to smartphones. Currently only about 2.5 billion of the worlds 7 billion people are smartphone users, however by 2020 that number is expected to soar to 6.1 billion smartphone users, with the growth largely fueled by developing markets. This huge growth in smartphone users will lead to the revolution in mobile payments. </p>
                        <p>Mobile payment is to a very broad term, which can refer to any of the numerous different categories of mobile payments. One of these categories is In-app mobile payments, which involves a third party application that sells its unique product to a user and allows the user to make a payment right within the app to avoid making a payment in person. Starbucks and Dominos are two corporations that use in-app mobile payments. Another category is contactless mobile payments, which uses near field communication (NFC) to complete transactions. Contactless mobile payments can be completed by simply waving a mobile device, credit/debit card, or fob across the terminal. Examples of such payments include Android Pay, Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and Samsung Pay. Peer to Peer Payments (P2P) is another popular form of mobile payment, which involves the transfer of money between individuals with a text message, email, or a third party application. Examples of P2P payments include Venmo, Google Wallet, and Square Cash. The last form of mobile payment is MPOS (mobile point of sales), which uses a smartphone/tablet to accept credit/debit card payments from customers. This type of payment often involves the use of a plug-in card reader along with a mobile application, which has an interface that is similar to a traditional register. Examples of MPOS are VeriFone and Square.  </p>
                        <p>The most promising aspects of Mobile payments are their reliability and convenience. Mobile payments are also attractive to many users because of their security. In general these new payment methods are significantly more secure than the traditional forms of payments. For example Google Wallet and Android Pay both have 24/7 Fraud monitoring and the user receives an instant notification immediately after a transactions. Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay also have tamper resistant security chips, which protect the secret codes used to make payments and these tamper resistant chip guards against physical attacks and malware on your smartphone, making it a safer option than a traditional credit card. Select smartphone users also have the privilege to use biometric authentication to protect their information on their smartphones. </p>
                        <p>Venmo is a popular P2P mobile payment method that has been soaring in popularity. P2P mobile payments have risen in popularity due mainly to their convenience. P2P payments have made sending and receiving money from family and friends easier than ever. According to company data, Venmo has handled over $2 billion dollars in transactions last quarter, up about half a billion dollars from the previous quarter. Venmo’s simplicity and sturdy security system, which uses data encryption to store customers financial information on their servers, makes it a popular app for customers. Venmo is also working with merchants to develop a platform where customers can make payments using Venmo which would make it a strong competition to the larger tech giants and their own mobile payment platforms: Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Android Pay. </p>
                        <p>Many businesses, both small and large, have begun to shift away from the traditional way of payment and adopt these new technologies. Many companies have integrated these new technologies into their businesses. One of these companies is Starbucks, where mobile payments account for over 20% of their business. Mobile payments, however, are having a much more significant impact on small businesses rather than large corporations. Small to medium sized businesses are finding it more convenient and cost effective to switch to payment methods such as Square and VeriFone. Square for example charges small businesses a flat 2.75 percent fee per swipe, which is significantly lower than the combined fees that many small and medium sized businesses receive from credit card companies.</p>
                        <p>A handful of banks have also begun to embrace mobile technology in order to run their businesses. Earlier this year Citibank and BMO Harris Bank began testing new card-less ATMS, which are capable of making transactions using just a mobile phone. The ATM allows users to use Near Field Communication (NFC) or a QR code to authenticate themselves and complete any transaction for which they previously needed a card for before. </p>
                        <p>Given the significant advances in mobile payments and banking, people are quickly switching from these traditional forms of payments and starting to embrace these new methods, indicating that it won’t be too long before society completely decides to ditch plastic and paper for a completely electronic method. </p>
