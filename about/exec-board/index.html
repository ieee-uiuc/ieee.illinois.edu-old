        <a href="mailto:ieee-corporate@illinois.edu">ieee-corporate@illinois.edu</a>
        <p>I am a rising junior at the University of Illinois majoring in electrical engineering with the intent to focus on the power and energy field. I just finished my math, science and introductory electrical engineering pre-requisites this past year. I intend to take electronic circuits, power circuits and electromechanics, and green electric energy within the next upcoming year. I have taken up the time consuming position as a corporate director for our student branch of IEEE for the next year and am currently the president of my fraternity. I had the opportunity to work with Consolidated Edison last summer as an intern in IT and I am currently interning with GE Energy Connections. This upcoming semester I will be working part time for Ameren Illinois at their innovation center in Champaign IL. I expect that the upcoming year will be very demanding, however, I know that if I push through and manage my time well it will also be very rewarding in the long run.</p>
