				<h2>What is IEEE?</h2>
				<hr />

				<p>The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, or IEEE, is the world’s leading professional association for the advancement of technology involving electricity. The purpose of IEEE as an organization is to disseminate knowledge of the theory and practice of all aspects of electrical, electronics, communications and computer engineering, as well as computer science, the allied Branches of engineering and the related arts and sciences. IEEE serves as a mean for students to further their professional and educational development.</p>

				<h2>IEEE UIUC Student Branch</h2>
				<hr />

				<p>The formation of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s IEEE Student Branch took place in July 1947, the same year the transistor was invented by John Bardeen at Bell Labs. Back then, IEEE was called AIEE-IRE which was a joint organization between the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE). It wasn’t until 1963 when AIEE and IRE merged to form the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, known as IEEE. Over the years, the student branch has changed and adapated to the times: we've changed our structure and ran different events, among other things.</p>

				<p>We are comprised of three branches: Technical, Professional, and Membership Services. The Technical branch is centered around learning about new aspects of ECE, whether it be through workshops, projects, or TAGs. The Professional branch revolves around networking, corporate relations, and professional development. Finally, the Membership Services branch focuses on engaging our members through social events, publicity materials, and awards.</p>

				<p>As a student organization, IEEE works closely with students on campus and different engineering organizations. We continue to work with organizations and student branches like Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), WECE (Women in ECE), and ACM (Association of Computing Machinery), to name a few.</p>

				<p>Furthermore, IEEE works closely with our contacts in the industry. This includes helping with recruitment activities, setting up tech talks, info sessions, luncheons, etc. The board is always brainstorming ideas to give companies the opportunity to meet students, obtain resumes, and advertise while letting students know about possible employers.</p>

		  		<p>Ultimately, we are a registered student organization of the students, by the students, and for the students. We are always open to all students, regardless of any demographic, including major. For more information on our structure and values, please see our constitution below.</p>
