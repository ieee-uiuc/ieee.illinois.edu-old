      <h2>About TAGs</h2>

          <p>
            IEEE is excited to broadcast some new changes to its structure, starting with the 2015 - 2016 school year. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The most common question we found ourselves being asked was: "How does one get involved with IEEE?". Besides committees, which are largely administrative, it's difficult to really get involved in IEEE UIUC and truly learn something, whether actively or passively. IEEE is, after all, a technical organization, and student branches should reflect that for our members. Further, it's difficult to join a committee after the start of the semester. Effectively, we weren’t making the opportunity to get involved as seamless as possible, and that’s something we were determined to change. Finally, the distribution and level of knowledge within the leadership wasn't great, making our activities unfavorable for growth. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution to these issues is Technical Advancement Groups – TAGs. We received lots of inspiration our friends over at ACM with their Special Interest Group (SIG) model. Each TAG is going to have a specific area of technical interest. To reflect that, each TAG chair is strong in that field. As such, the level of technical knowledge within IEEE UIUC grows significantly, but is now distributed at t he same time. 
          </p>
          <p>
            This is very new for us; we have no real precedent other than ACM. While their model is a great place to start, we still want to define our own path. Initially we're proposing TAGs be formed with some specific technical and applied concept in mind. The "initial run" of six TAGs are described above. We're always open to more great ideas, so if you feel confident in a certain field of ECE, <a href="mailto:ieee-technical@illinois.edu">contact us</a> about creating a TAG!
          </p>
          <p>
            Our expectations are that the TAG will meet at minimum twice a month, and offer a variety of services. How the events are handled are obviously up to each individual group, but ideally we’d like to see workshops, lecture series, and for research focused ones, paper reviews. Not every meeting, but at least one each per semester. Hope you guys are excited about this as we are!
