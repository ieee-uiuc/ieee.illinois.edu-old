        <p>The Projects Committee allows you get involved by working on your own projects, potentially getting funding for them, or finding others to work on projects together. We work with other organizations like iRobotics and ECE Pulse as well.</p>
        <p>Meeting Time: TBD</p>

        <h3 class="orange-text" id="technical-events">Technical Events Committee</h3>
        <p>The Technical Events Committee aims to hold and organize all workshops, hackathons, technical conferences,and other events. Workshops would include both general IEEE workshops, and holding workshops for each specific TAG to generate interest in their specific field. Throughout the year, we will also work to create new events that can potentially take place to enhance the technical branch of IEEE@UIUC. As a part of the committee, you will be involved with the majority of the planning for the various technical events that we might put on, along with a large portion of the creative behind many new events.</p>

        <p>There are three different positions in the Corporate Committee: Corporate Communicators, Event Planners and Publicity Members.  Corporate Communicators need to have exceptional written and verbal communication skills to reach out to companies for Tech Talks and Info Sessions.  Event Planners set up the Talks and makes sure everything runs smoothly.  Publicity Members spread the word about Corporate events by social media and marketing.</p>

        <p>The outreach committee aims at improving IEEEs relationship with EC (Engineering Council) and other RSOs (Registered Student Organizations) by hosting events and sharing resources. We will be working closely with all committees especially when help is required for co-hosting events such as Hackathons, social events, etc. Another goal is to work with other IEEE committees to coordinate events and seed projects.</p>

        <h3 class="orange-text" id="social">Social Committee</h3>
        <p>This committee focuses on organizing fun, social events for all members of IEEE. Each year, the biggest events we plan are barndances, barcrawls, and semi-formals. Our smaller events have ranged from dodgeball tournaments to ice skating socials. We try to co-host these events with other organizations to promote inclusion among many different students.</p>
        <p>One of our goals for this year is to plan more small-scale events and get more members involved in all aspects of IEEE. Additionally, members of this committee represent IEEE's team in Engineering Week, where we actively compete against other engineering organizations!</p>
